# NetworkStack
A full network stack utilizing the OSI model to explore network communication

## Motivation
The goals of this project are
* To deep dive into each seperate networking layer for greater understanding of network communication as a whole
* To utilize the speed of c++ and explore any advanced concepts needed to create each layer
* To create, as simple as possible, example implementations of each layer
* To create an application layer that exposes ports and sockets easily to understand the operation at a simple layer
* The end result goal is a full stack with an example application that utilizes all parts as a proof of concept
