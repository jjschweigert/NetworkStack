# NetworkStack
The purpose of this project is for learning more about network layers and protocols as well as diving deeper into c++. The end goal will be a full network stack that implements all of the layers of the OSI model including the physical layer. Understanding at the physical layer how different cables effect transfer of data and how the electrical impulses are sent/read and interpreted. All the way up to the application layer to implement an example application that implements all of the lower layers for proof of concept.
